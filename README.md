# instagram_bot
Simple project using tryleap.ai and Facebook Graph API to run an Instagram Business Account automatically, 
generating images on-demand based on a base model and a description provided by the user.

The image generation is done by tryleap ai, provided a model and a description you'll obtain an image.

Using Facebook Graph API and an Instagram Buisness Account, you can upload the image directly to your account,
providing also a description 


In the future the image description could be done by another AI after it "sees" the generated image, Ã 
for now it's written by the user.
The same goes for the generation of the image, making the account completely runned by a bot.
